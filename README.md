This project is a personal portfolio website designed to showcase my professional skills, projects, and experiences. It serves as a digital resume and a platform where potential employers and collaborators can learn more about my work and get in touch with me.

In today's digital age, having an online presence is crucial. A personal portfolio allows me to:

- Provide a single, easily accessible point of reference for my professional information.
- The portfolio is built using modern web technologies to ensure responsiveness and a smooth user experience. Here are the key steps and tools involved:


Planning and Design:


Sketch initial wireframes and design the layout using tools like Figma.


Development:



- Use HTML, CSS to create the structure and interactivity of the site.

- Implement responsive design principles to ensure the site looks great on all devices.


Content Creation:
